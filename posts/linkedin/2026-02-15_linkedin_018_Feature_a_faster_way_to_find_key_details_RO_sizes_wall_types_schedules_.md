**One feature we’re focused on in BuilderPulseAI:**
a faster way to find key details (RO sizes, wall types, schedules)

Why it matters for site supers:
- fewer “where is that?” moments
- less context switching
- faster decisions when the field needs answers

If you want early access, reply “PILOT”.
