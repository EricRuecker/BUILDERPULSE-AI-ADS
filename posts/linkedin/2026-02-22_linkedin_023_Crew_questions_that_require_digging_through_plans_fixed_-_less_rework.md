Hot take: your workflow shouldn’t depend on someone remembering where a PDF is saved.

**Problem:** Crew questions that require digging through plans.  
**What we're building:** BuilderPulseAI — structured info extraction to reduce manual re-typing.  
**Goal:** a smoother workflow from plans → production, without adding another messy process.
