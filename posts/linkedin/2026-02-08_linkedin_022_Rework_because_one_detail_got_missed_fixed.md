Hot take: your workflow shouldn’t depend on someone remembering where a PDF is saved.

**Problem:** Rework because one detail got missed.  
**What we're building:** BuilderPulseAI — an AI agent roadmap for automated panel design and takeoff support.  
**Goal:** cleaner handoffs, without adding another messy process.

If you want to test it early, DM me and I’ll set you up.
