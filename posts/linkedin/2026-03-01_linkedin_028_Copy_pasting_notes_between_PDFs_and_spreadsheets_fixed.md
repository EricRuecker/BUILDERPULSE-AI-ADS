Hot take: your workflow shouldn’t depend on someone remembering where a PDF is saved.

**Problem:** Copy/pasting notes between PDFs and spreadsheets.  
**What we're building:** BuilderPulseAI — structured info extraction to reduce manual re-typing.  
**Goal:** less time wasted searching, without adding another messy process.

If you want to test it early, DM me and I’ll set you up.
