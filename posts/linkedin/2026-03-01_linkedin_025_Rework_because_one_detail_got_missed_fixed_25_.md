If you’ve ever lost 30 minutes just finding one detail in the plans…

**Problem:** Rework because one detail got missed.  
**What we're building:** BuilderPulseAI — structured info extraction to reduce manual re-typing.  
**Goal:** a smoother workflow from plans → production, without adding another messy process.

Curious if this fits your workflow? Shoot me a message.
