Hot take: your workflow shouldn’t depend on someone remembering where a PDF is saved.

**Problem:** Slow handoffs between office and site.  
**What we're building:** BuilderPulseAI — centralized project workspace for drawings + notes + tasks.  
**Goal:** better visibility on what’s happening, without adding another messy process.
