**One feature we’re focused on in BuilderPulseAI:**
AI-assisted document search (ask questions, get answers from the drawings)

Why it matters for framing contractors:
- fewer “where is that?” moments
- less context switching
- faster decisions when the field needs answers

If you want early access, reply “PILOT”.
