Most teams don’t have a labor problem — they have an info problem.

**Problem:** Estimating and takeoff taking way too long.  
**What we're building:** BuilderPulseAI — PDF viewer workflow built for construction teams.  
**Goal:** a smoother workflow from plans → production, without adding another messy process.
