Hot take: your workflow shouldn’t depend on someone remembering where a PDF is saved.

**Problem:** Rework because one detail got missed.  
**What we're building:** BuilderPulseAI — a faster way to find key details (RO sizes, wall types, schedules).  
**Goal:** less time wasted searching, without adding another messy process.

If you want to test it early, DM me and I’ll set you up.
