Most teams don’t have a labor problem — they have an info problem.

**Problem:** Crew questions that require digging through plans.  
**What we're building:** BuilderPulseAI — centralized project workspace for drawings + notes + tasks.  
**Goal:** better visibility on what’s happening, without adding another messy process.

If you want early access, comment “PILOT” and I’ll reach out.
