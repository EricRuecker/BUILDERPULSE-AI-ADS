Plan sets are getting bigger. Timelines are not.

**Problem:** Losing time hunting for window/door sizes.  
**What we're building:** BuilderPulseAI — AI-assisted document search (ask questions, get answers from the drawings).  
**Goal:** faster takeoffs, without adding another messy process.

If you’re tired of plan chaos, DM me — I’ll walk you through it.
