A question I hear all the time from builders:

**Problem:** Version chaos: 'final_final_v7.pdf'.  
**What we're building:** BuilderPulseAI — structured info extraction to reduce manual re-typing.  
**Goal:** more consistent estimates, without adding another messy process.

If you want early access, comment “PILOT” and I’ll reach out.
