A question I hear all the time from builders:

**Problem:** Estimating and takeoff taking way too long.  
**What we're building:** BuilderPulseAI — an AI agent roadmap for automated panel design and takeoff support.  
**Goal:** less time wasted searching, without adding another messy process.

Want a demo? Reply “DEMO” and I’ll send a link.
