Most teams don’t have a labor problem — they have an info problem.

**Problem:** Crew questions that require digging through plans.  
**What we're building:** BuilderPulseAI — centralized project workspace for drawings + notes + tasks.  
**Goal:** faster takeoffs, without adding another messy process.
