Most teams don’t have a labor problem — they have an info problem.

**Problem:** Losing time hunting for window/door sizes.  
**What we're building:** BuilderPulseAI — structured info extraction to reduce manual re-typing.  
**Goal:** fewer surprises in the field, without adding another messy process.

If you’re tired of plan chaos, DM me — I’ll walk you through it.
